Description of the lesson
-------

Classifying irises based on their characteristics and classes using Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

- Run SVMs along with the visualization from the Overview for all the combinations of fields (there are four) for each combination of flower types (there are three). Are there clear boundaries between the flower types based on the various combinations of fields? Is there a particular combination that separates a flower type cleanly? Is there a particular combination that separates the flower types almost cleanly?

- Run SVM code for classifying three flowers at a time. How is the code different?

- Try adjusting the code for a wider soft margin. Focus on classifying flowers without clean boundaries. How does a wider margin help? Is there a point where the margin becomes too wide? Too narrow?
